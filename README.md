# Portal text size changer
This repository will no longer be updated - continued updates will be done as part of 
https://github.com/sigmagamma/portl


This creates and installs a portal configuration file that increases the size of the close captions and reduces the size of the credits text in Portal.
Currently only supports Windows.
Release is here:
https://www.moddb.com/mods/portal-text-size-changer/downloads/portal-text-size-changer

The code extracts clientscheme.res into a custom folder, and modifies the relevant text sizes.

The code for this is based on the right to left translation mod:
